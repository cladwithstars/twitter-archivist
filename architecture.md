## Motivation 
This application allows users to save and organize tweets to their private account. It can be thought of as an enhancement to Twitter's bookmarks feature.
It was motivated by the fact that Twitter's bookmark feature is lacking in some key desirable features. For instance, you are unable to sort or organize bookmarks into subfolders. There is also no search feature. Additionally, bookmarks are lost if the tweet is deleted, or the tweet-author's account is deactivated. 
With Twitter Archivist, you can easily import tweets from twitter and save them to your account. They are now stored forever, regardless if they are deleted on the twitter app. You can organize them into searchable subfolders by category or by author, allowing for simple and instant lookup.
