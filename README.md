# super-twitmarks

An enhancement to Twitter's bookmark feature. Inside twitter (as of 2022), you cannot arrange bookmarked tweets into folders, limiting the use of the feature severely. But this application allows you to do just that. It also allows you to search within folders, for easy access. 
You also lose tweets when they are deleted or the account of the tweeter is deleted. But here, tweets are saved to the db, so you never lose them. The Twitter archivist-hobbyist dream application.

A MERN application using Material-UI as a component library.
