# super-twitmarks

An enhancement to Twitter's bookmark feature. Inside twitter, you cannot sort or arrange bookmarked tweets into folders. But this application allows you to do just that. 
You also lose tweets when they are deleted or the account of the tweeter is deleted. But here, tweets are saved to the db, so you never lose them.

A MERN application using Material-UI as a component library.
