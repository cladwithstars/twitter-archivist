# twitter-archivist

An enhancement to Twitter's bookmark feature. Inside Twitter (as of 2022) you cannot arrange bookmarked tweets into folders, limiting the usefulness of the feature severely. But this application allows you to do just that. It also allows you to search within folders, for easy lookup of tweets - again as of 2022, the searchability of tweets is pitiful, so this is much needed. 
Additionally, inside the Twitter application (or on the site) you lose saved tweets when they are deleted or the account of the tweeter is deleted. But here, tweets are saved to the db, so you never lose them - even if they are deleted on the Twitter app. Thus, this is the Twitter archivist-hobbyist's dream application.

It is a MERN app.

Note, this application is a work in progress. The code can be cleaned up and there are many more features planned for the future, such as supporting more media types.
